# Ethos App — API Spec

## Conventions

### Base URL
All API routes are Next.js API routes under `/api/`.
Supabase client handles direct database queries where no business logic is needed.
Next.js API routes are used for:
- Operations requiring the service role key
- Business logic (limit enforcement, multi-step operations)
- Third-party integration triggers (Slack, OpenSign, Resend)

### Authentication
Every protected endpoint requires a valid Supabase JWT in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <supabase_jwt_token>
```
Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints return `401 Unauthorized`.

### Response format
All responses return JSON.
Success:
```json
{ "data": { ... }, "error": null }
```
Error:
```json
{ "data": null, "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message" } }
```

### Error codes used throughout
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| UNAUTHORIZED | No valid JWT provided |
| FORBIDDEN | Valid JWT but insufficient permissions |
| NOT_FOUND | Resource does not exist or not visible to requester |
| VALIDATION_ERROR | Request body failed validation |
| LIMIT_REACHED | A business rule limit was hit (e.g. 3 active projects) |
| CONFLICT | Duplicate or conflicting record |
| INTEGRATION_ERROR | Third-party service call failed |
